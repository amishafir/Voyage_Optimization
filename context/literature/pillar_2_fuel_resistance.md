# Pillar 2: Fuel Consumption & Resistance Modeling

**Purpose:** Justify the physics model (Tables 2-4, Equations 7-16) and the cubic FCR relationship. Frame the Jensen's inequality insight.

**Gap to establish:** The cubic FCR convexity is well known in naval architecture, but its implication for segment-averaged LP optimization under SOG-targeting has not been analyzed. Jensen's inequality on cubic FCR is the mechanism, but nobody has connected it to the LP vs DP ranking reversal.

**Sub-topics:** Power-speed relationship (2.7-3.3 exponent), Resistance decomposition (Holtrop-Mennen, Hollenbach, ITTC-1957), Added resistance in waves, Current effects on SOG, FCR convexity / Jensen's inequality
