# Pillar 3: Weather Forecasting & NWP Models

**Purpose:** Ground the forecast error analysis and NWP cycle findings in meteorological literature.

**Gap to establish:** Speed optimization papers typically assume either perfect weather or a single forecast. Nobody has measured how forecast degradation with lead time propagates through the optimizer to affect fuel outcomes. Our forecast error curve + horizon sweep fills this.

**Sub-topics:** GFS/ECMWF forecast accuracy, NWP update cycles, Forecast accuracy in maritime context, Open-Meteo/reanalysis data, Atmospheric predictability limit
