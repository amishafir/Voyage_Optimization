# Pillar 1: Ship Speed Optimization

**Purpose:** Show what exists in ship speed optimization, identify the gap — no one compares LP vs DP vs RH under realistic simulation on the same route with the same physics model.

**Gap to establish:** Most papers compare one method against a baseline. Nobody does LP vs DP vs RH on the same route with the same physics model, and nobody examines how the simulation model (SOG-target vs fixed-SWS) affects the ranking.

**Sub-topics:** LP-based voyage optimization, DP/graph-based approaches, Rolling horizon/MPC in maritime, Metaheuristics (GA, PSO), Weather routing vs speed optimization
