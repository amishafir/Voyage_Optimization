# Pillar 6: Regulatory & Industry Context

**Purpose:** Motivate the entire thesis — why does fuel optimization matter now?

**Gap to establish:** Regulations now mandate fuel efficiency, but the tools available (LP-based, constant-weather assumptions) are inadequate. Dynamic approaches with real forecast data are needed but underdeveloped.

**Sub-topics:** IMO GHG strategy (2023 revision), EEXI, CII, EU ETS for shipping (2024), SEEMP Part III
