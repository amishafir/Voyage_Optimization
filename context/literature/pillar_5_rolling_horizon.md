# Pillar 5: Rolling Horizon & Information Value

**Purpose:** Position RH as superior and explain why through information theory.

**Gap to establish:** Rolling horizon exists in OR theory but is rarely applied to ship speed optimization with real forecast data. Nobody has analyzed the interaction between NWP model refresh cycles and optimal replan frequency.

**Sub-topics:** Rolling horizon in stochastic optimization, Value of information (VOI), Stochastic weather routing, Re-planning frequency in operations, Forecast horizon vs decision horizon
