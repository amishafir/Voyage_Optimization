# Pillar 4: Simulation Methodology & SOG-Targeting

**Purpose:** Defend SOG-targeting as the correct simulation model. This is the most novel methodological contribution.

**Gap to establish:** The maritime optimization literature overwhelmingly simulates plans by holding SWS constant (what the engine does). But ships target SOG (to meet arrival schedules). This difference, through Jensen's inequality on cubic FCR, reverses the LP vs DP ranking. Nobody has identified this.

**Sub-topics:** SOG-targeting in practice, Just-in-time arrival / virtual arrival, Plan-vs-actual simulation frameworks, Slow steaming literature, Jensen's inequality in applied optimization
