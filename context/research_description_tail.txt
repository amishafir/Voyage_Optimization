The  study  focuses  on  minimizing  fuel  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  of  
cargo
 
vessels
 
(
 
tankers,
 
bulk
 
carriers
 
,
 
containers
 
etc..).
 
The
 
main
 
contributor
 
is
 
the
 
vessel
 
speed:
 
There
 
is
 
a
 
nonlinear
 
relationship
 
between
 
the
 
SWS
 
(
 
Still
 
water
 
speed
 
)
 
-
 
the
 
speed
 
that
 
the
 
engine
 
produces,
 
and
 
the
 
overall
 
fuel
 
consumption.
 
It
 
means
 
that
 
small
 
changes
 
in
 
engine
 
speed
 
result
 
in
 
an
 
increase
 
in
 
the
 
power
 
(
 
between
 
2.7
 
and
 
3.3
 
).
 
If
 
the
 
only
 
target
 
during
 
a
 
vessel
 
voyage
 
is
 
to
 
reduce
 
fuel
 
consumption,
 
the
 
answer
 
will
 
be
 
to
 
sail
 
at
 
the
 
lowest
 
speed
 
possible.
  
Adhering
 
to
 
desired
 
time
 
of
 
arrival
 
(DTA),
 
is
 
the
 
place
 
where
 
a
 
vessel
 
must
 
increase
 
engine
 
speed,
 
and
 
consume
 
additional
 
fuel.
 
Another
 
consideration
 
of
 
speed
 
control,
 
is
 
the
 
actual
 
SOG
 
(
 
speed
 
over
 
ground
 
),
 
this
 
is
 
the
 
linear
 
speed
 
that
 
combines
 
the
 
speed
 
gained
 
from
 
the
 
engine
 
(
 
SWS
 
)
 
and
 
weather
 
and
 
sea
 
conditions
 
(
 
wind,
 
wave
 
,
 
currents
 
..
 
)
 
.
 
Using
 
physical
 
formulas
 
that
 
translate
 
weather
 
and
 
sea
 
conditions,
 
combined
 
with
 
naval
 
architecture
 
standards,
 
the
 
calculation
 
of
 
speed
 
consumption
 
and
 
SOG,
 
in
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
different
 
engine
 
power
 
(SWS)
 
is
 
fairly
 
feasible.
   As  a  graduate  student  in  machine  learning  and  operation  research,  I  want  this  thesis  to  
contribute
 
to
 
the
 
following
 
question:
 
For
 
a
 
fixed
 
ship
 
route
 
divided
 
into
 
n
 
segments
 
between
 
departure
 
port
 
A
 
and
 
destination
 
port
 B  where  the  bearing  of  the  ship  in  each  segment  is  fixed,  determine  the  optimal  Still  Water  Speed  (SWS)  for  each  segment  to  minimize  the  total  fuel  consumption  over  the  voyage  while  ensuring  arrival  at  port  B  is  not  later  than  a  desired  time  of  arrival  (DTA).  Each  segment  has  fixed  and  known  weather  and  sea  conditions  (wind,  waves,  and  ocean  currents)  affecting  the  vessel’s  speed.  The  first  step  of  the  research  is  to  proove  that  by  modeling  the  problem  as  a  linear  
optimization
 
problem,
 
can
 
produce
 
an
 
optimal
 
solution,
 
superior
 
to
 
a
 
heuristic
 
approach.
 
The
 
benchmark
 
for
 
heuristic
 
solution,
 
is
 
a
 
journal
  
article
 
named
 
“
 
Ship
 
Speed
 
Optimization
 
Considering
 
Ocean
 
Currents
 
to
 
Enhance
 
Environmental
 
Sustainability
 
in
 
Maritime
 
Shipping
 
“.
 
the
 
article
 
provides
 
2
 
main
 
important
 
factors:
 1.  Detailed  formulation  of  maritime  parameters  calculation  (  SOG,  Fuel  consumption..)  2.  Detailed  use  case  of  a  12  segment  voyage  ,  with  weather  and  sea  condition  data   The  article  provides  the  solution  approach,  and  the  minimal  fuel  consumption  that  the  
algorithm
 
achieved.
 
The
 
first
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
thesis
 
\
 
journal
 
article,
 
is
 
to
 
provide:
 1.  Literature  review  2.  Research  approach  3.  Problem  definition  and  mathematical  formulation  4.  Results  and  comparison  against  heuristic  approach  baseline  
   In  order  to  "level  the  playing  field”  ,  I've  first  implemented  all  the  equations  from  the  article,  
into
 
a
 
python
 
code.
 
The
 
target
 
was
 
to
 
use
 
the
 
same
 
baseline
 
of
 
parameters
 
calculations
 
(
 
SOG,
 
FCR)
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
valid
 
.DATA
 
file.
 
The
 
file
 
with
 
all
 
the
 
necessary
 
calculation,
 
was
 
then
 
used
 
in
 
a
 
linear
 
programing
 
model,
 
that
 
produced
 
a
 
new
 
set
 
of
 
optimised
 
results.
 The  first  step  of  validation  was  to  take  the  article’s  SWS  input,  SOG  output,  and  compare  it  
with
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
inputs
 
through
 
my
 
utility
 
functions
 
implementation.
 
The
 
goal
 
was

to  see  minimum  discrepancies  between  article  SOG  and  calculated  SOG.  results  below:

The  next  step  of  the  research  is  to  solve  the  optimization  problem,  but  this  time  in  a  situation  
where
 
the
 
sea
 
conditions
 
are
 
not
 
constant
 
during
 
the
 
voyage.
 
It
 
means
 
that
 
the
 
weather/
 
sea
 
conditions
 
are
 
changing
 
over
 
time.
 
It
 
means
 
that
 
a
 
speed
 
change
 
decision
 
is
 
dependent
 
on
 
actual
 
changeable
 
conditions.
  I  want  to  construct  a  directed  graph.  every  node  represent  a  square  in  a  matrix  of  mile  (  distance  from  start  point  )  and  time  (  time  
passed
 
from
 
start
 
time
 
)
  there  is  a  finite  numbers  of  miles  (should  be   an  input  parameter  )  and  finite  number  of  hours  
to
 
complete
 
the
 
voyage
 
(
 
should
 
be
 
an
 
input
 
parameter
 
)
  every  node  has  an  attribute  of  "environmental  and  sea  conditions".  the  condition  for  every  node,  should  be  managed  in  an  external  table  to  the  graph.   the  cost  of  transitioning  between  nodes,  is  a  function  of  two  decision  variables:  -  SWS  (  steal  water  speed  ),  the  natural  speed  an  engine  is  producing  -  sail  time  of  a  desired  segment  ,  how  long  do  the  speed  sail  in  a  SWS  speed   A  dedicated  formula,  that  uses  the  external  condition  table,transposes  the  sws  decision  into  
a
 
SOG
 
(speed
 
over
 
ground)
 
result.
 
The
 
multiplication
 
of
 
SOG
 
and
 
sail
 
time,
 
should
 
produce
 
two
 
outcomes:
 
-
 
the
 
next
 
node
 
in
 
the
 
graph
 
(
 
miles
 
from
 
start
 
point,
 
time
 
from
 
start
 
point
 
)
 
-
 
cost
 
of
 
transition,
 
a
 
formula
 
that
 
takes
 
the
 
SWS
 
and
 
computes
 
the
 
FCR
 
(
 
fuel
 
consumption
 
rate
 
).
 
The
 
multiplication
 
of
 
FCR
 
and
 
Sail
 
time,
 
is
 
the
 
“fuel
 
consumption
 
cost”
 
of
 
sailing
 
between
 
the
 
nodes,
 
AKA
 
graph
 
weight.
 
 The  method  of  constructing  the  graph  is  as  follows:  
Input
 
parameters:
 -  Segment  length  -  the  distance  needed  to  cover  in  the  same  bearing,  regardless  of  
the
 
sea
 
conditions.
 
Every
 
segment
 
starts
 
exactly
 
where
 
a
 
previous
 
segment
 
ends.
 -  Sea  conditions  for  every  segment  -  the  sea  and  weather  conditions,  for  every  
segment,
 
in
 
a
 
constant
 
time
 
window
 -  Time  window  (weather  forecast  granularity)  -  the  time  elapse  between  weather  
forecasts
 -  SOG  formula  -  SOG  calculation  that  derives  from  a  combination  of  SWS  decision,  
and
 
pre
 
defined
 
weather
 
conditions
 
for
 
the
 
segment
 -  FCR  formula-  FCR  calculation  that  derives  from  a  combination  of  SWS  decision  -  SWS  range  (knots)  -  Speed  granularity  (knots)   Graph  entities:  -  Node:  defined  by  two  points  (distance  from  start  point,  time  elapsed  from  start  point)  -  Edge:defined  by  two  points  (  exit  node  ,  destination  node  )  -  Attribute:  fuel  consumption  of  sailing  between  exit  and  destination  nodes  Graph  construction  algorithm:  1.  Create  one  data  structure  to  log  the  nodes  and  a  different  data  structure  to  log  the  edges  
1.
 
Start
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
the
 
first
 
segment
 
,
 
and
 
construct
 
the
 
depot
 
node
 
(0,0)

For  the  input  speed  range  and  speed  granularity  (  after  transitioning  to  SOG):  -  If  (  remaining  distance  until  next  segment  /  SOG)  <  time  until  next  time  window)   Than:   create  new  destination_node  Else:   create  new  time_node     Speed_information  =  {Min_speed  :  11,  Max_speed:13,  Speed_granularity:  0.1}    Segments_table:
