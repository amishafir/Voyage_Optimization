# Thesis Brainstorm: Maritime Speed Optimization Under Operational Realism

---

## 1. Central Claim

> Under operationally realistic SOG-targeting, segment-averaged LP optimization is equivalent to no optimization at all. Only per-node dynamic approaches (DP, Rolling Horizon) provide genuine fuel savings. The value of dynamic optimization depends primarily on forecast accuracy relative to voyage duration.

**Five contributions:**
1. **Simulation model matters** — SOG-target vs fixed-SWS reverses the LP/DP ranking (Jensen's inequality on cubic FCR)
2. **LP ≈ constant speed** — LP (368.0 kg) = constant speed (367.9 kg) under realistic execution
3. **Forecast horizon is route-length dependent** — dominant on long routes (280h), negligible on short routes (140h)
4. **Information value hierarchy** — temporal > spatial > re-planning, confirmed by 2x2 factorial
5. **Forecast error curve** — wind RMSE doubles over 133h with systematic overpredict bias, completing the causal chain

## 2. Canonical Results

### SOG-Target Model (ETA=280h, full route)

| Approach | Plan Fuel | Sim Fuel | Gap | Sim Time | SWS Violations |
|----------|:---------:|:--------:|:---:|:--------:|:--------------:|
| **Rolling Horizon** | 361.4 kg | **364.8 kg** | 0.92% | 282.1h | 60/278 (22%) |
| **Dynamic DP** | 365.3 kg | **366.9 kg** | 0.42% | 281.2h | 62/278 (22%) |
| **Static LP** | 358.4 kg | **368.0 kg** | 2.69% | 280.3h | 10/278 (4%) |
| Constant SOG (12.13 kn) | — | **367.9 kg** | — | 280.3h | 9/278 (3%) |
| Lower bound (calm) | — | **352.6 kg** | — | 280.0h | 0 |
| Upper bound (13 kn) | — | **406.9 kg** | — | — | 171 |

Optimization potential: 54.3 kg range. RH captures 77.6%, DP 73.8%, LP 71.8% ≈ constant-speed 71.9%.

### The Ranking Reversal

| Approach | Fixed-SWS (old) | SOG-Target (new) |
|----------|:---------------:|:----------------:|
| LP | **361.8 kg (best)** | 368.0 kg (worst) |
| DP | 367.8 kg (worst) | **366.9 kg (best)** |
| RH | 364.4 kg | 364.8 kg |

**Mechanism:** LP picks one SOG per segment from averaged weather. Under SOG-targeting, maintaining that SOG at individual nodes where weather differs from the average requires SWS adjustments. Cubic FCR (0.000706 × SWS³) means harsh-node penalties always outweigh calm-node savings (Jensen's inequality). The averaging that helped LP plan now hurts it in execution.

## 3. Factor Decomposition

### Full Route (controlled experiments)

| Factor | How Measured | Impact |
|--------|-------------|:------:|
| Weather source (actual vs predicted) | LP_actual vs LP_predicted | **0 kg** |
| Segment averaging (12 seg vs 278 legs) | DP_actual vs LP_actual | **-2.4 kg** |
| Forecast error (predicted vs actual) | DP_predicted vs DP_actual | **+8.4 kg** |
| Re-planning (DP vs RH) | RH vs DP, same config | **-2.1 kg** |
| Forecast horizon (default vs 168h) | Horizon sweep at ETA=285h | **-8 kg** |
| Replan frequency (3h vs 48h) | Replan sweep | **~0 kg** |

### 2x2 Factorial (short route, exp_a/b)

| Config | Nodes | Weather | Approach | Fuel (kg) |
|--------|:-----:|---------|----------|:---------:|
| A-LP | 7 | actual | LP (6 seg) | **178.19** |
| A-DP | 7 | predicted | DP | **181.20** |
| B-LP | 138 | actual | LP (6 seg) | **180.63** |
| B-DP | 138 | predicted | DP | **182.22** |
| B-RH | 138 | predicted | RH | **180.89** |

```
Temporal effect (forecast error):    +3.02 kg  ← largest
Spatial effect (segment averaging):  +2.44 kg
Interaction (spatial mitigates):     -1.43 kg
RH benefit (re-planning):           -1.33 kg  ← consistent
```

The negative interaction means finer spatial resolution partially compensates for forecast error — per-node predicted weather is closer to per-node actual weather than segment averages are.

## 4. Sensitivity Analyses

### Horizon Sweep — Full Route (ETA=285h)

| Horizon | DP Fuel | RH Fuel | RH Violations |
|---------|:-------:|:-------:|:-------------:|
| 72h | 359.6 | 357.2 | 10 |
| 96h | 360.7 | 358.1 | 23 |
| 120h | 360.4 | 358.1 | 18 |
| 144h | 359.1 | 357.3 | 42 |
| 168h | 359.1 | 356.6 | 47 |

**Plateau from 72h onward** (~1.5 kg range). 72h (26% of voyage) captures nearly all benefit. Violations increase with horizon — more information enables more aggressive plans.

### Horizon Sweep — Short Route (exp_b, ~140h voyage)

| Horizon | Ratio | DP Fuel | RH Fuel |
|---------|:-----:|:-------:|:-------:|
| 24h | 17% | 177.70 | 176.46 |
| 48h | 34% | 177.72 | 176.41 |
| 72h | 51% | 177.70 | 176.47 |
| 144h | 103% | 177.78 | 176.54 |

**Completely flat** — DP range 0.08 kg, RH range 0.19 kg. Even a 24h forecast (17% of voyage) is sufficient. The short route fits entirely within the accurate forecast window.

**Critical insight:** The relevant variable is not absolute horizon length but `voyage_duration / forecast_accuracy_horizon`. If the voyage fits within the accurate forecast window (~72-96h for wind), any horizon suffices. If it extends beyond, longer horizons help up to the accuracy limit.

### Replan Frequency (full route)

| Freq | Fuel (kg) | Delta |
|------|:---------:|:-----:|
| 3h | 364.85 | — |
| 6h | 364.76 | -0.09 |
| 24h | 364.50 | -0.35 |
| 48h | 364.72 | -0.13 |

Range <0.35 kg — negligible.

## 5. Forecast Error Curve (ground truth, 0-133h)

From exp_b (138 nodes × 134 samples):

| Lead Time | Wind RMSE (km/h) | Wind Bias | Wave RMSE (m) | Current RMSE (km/h) |
|:---------:|:----------------:|:---------:|:-------------:|:-------------------:|
| 0h | 4.13 | +0.20 | 0.052 | 0.358 |
| 24h | 4.84 | +0.59 | 0.072 | 0.382 |
| 48h | 5.63 | +1.21 | 0.076 | 0.406 |
| 72h | 6.13 | +1.31 | 0.094 | 0.448 |
| 96h | 7.65 | +2.86 | 0.114 | 0.460 |
| 120h | 8.34 | +3.15 | 0.118 | 0.443 |
| 133h | 8.40 | +2.67 | 0.113 | 0.503 |

**Wind RMSE doubles** (+103%). Error accelerates after 72h (atmospheric predictability limit). Systematic positive bias means forecasts overpredict wind → DP/RH prepare for headwinds that don't materialize → overspeed SWS violations.

This directly explains: (1) the horizon plateau at 72h, (2) the route-length dependence, (3) the SWS violation pattern.

## 6. SWS Violation Analysis

| Approach | Violations | Rate | Max Severity | Soft (<0.5 kn) | Very Hard (≥1.0 kn) |
|----------|:---------:|:----:|:------------:|:--------------:|:--------------------:|
| LP | 10 | 3.6% | 0.67 kn | 80% | 0% |
| DP | 62 | 22.3% | 1.46 kn | 50% | 6% |
| RH | 60 | 21.6% | 1.54 kn | 52% | 18% |

Violations cluster in segments 7-8 (Indian Ocean, ~2000-2500 nm) — 84-88% rate for DP/RH vs 16% for LP. Geographic pattern confirms weather-driven mechanism, not algorithmic failure.

**Fuel-feasibility tradeoff:** LP is safe but provides no fuel benefit. DP/RH save fuel but 22% of legs exceed engine limits (mostly soft violations).

---

## 7. Generalizability (two routes, two weather regimes)

| Finding | Full Route (3,394 nm, windier) | Short Route (1,678 nm, calmer) |
|---------|:--:|:--:|
| RH > DP > LP | Yes | Yes |
| LP ≈ constant speed | Yes | Yes |
| Replan negligible | Yes | Yes |
| Horizon matters | Yes (plateau at 72h) | No (flat from 24h) |

Weather comparison: wind std 10.63 vs 6.07 km/h, wave std 0.50 vs 0.26 m. Despite different conditions, the hierarchy holds. Horizon effect is the only route-dependent finding.

## 8. Thesis Structure

### Proposed Arc

1. **Lead with simulation model insight** — SOG-target vs fixed-SWS flips everything. Novel methodological contribution.
2. **Present LP ≈ constant-speed** — strongest, most surprising evidence.
3. **Layer in forecast horizon + route-length dependence** — explains when dynamic optimization matters.
4. **Organize as information value hierarchy** — actionable framework for practitioners.

## 11. Open Questions

### Resolved

1. ~~Horizon linear or knee?~~ → **Plateau** from 72h onward (~1.5 kg range)
2. ~~Does extended data change replan finding?~~ → **No.** RH-DP gap stable at ~1.3 kg
3. ~~Optimal horizon/voyage ratio?~~ → **Wrong framing.** Critical variable: `voyage_duration / forecast_accuracy_horizon`
4. ~~Can we decompose DP advantage?~~ → **Yes.** Temporal +3.02 > Spatial +2.44, interaction -1.43
5. ~~Should we add LP with predicted weather?~~ → **Yes.** Proves LP ≈ constant-speed
6. ~~Horizon sweep under SOG model?~~ → **Yes.** RH wins at every horizon
7. ~~SWS violation distribution?~~ → **80% soft for LP; 50/50 for DP/RH; clusters in segments 7-8**

### Still Open

1. **Is there a forecast quality threshold below which LP dominates?** (synthetic noise experiment)
2. **Is the route-length finding robust with 3-4 more routes?** (establishes breakeven curve)
3. **How does the hierarchy shift in extreme weather?** (monsoon, North Atlantic winter)
4. **Is SOG-targeting truly standard practice?** (IMO/EEXI citation needed)
5. **FCR exponent sensitivity?** (how sensitive are conclusions to ±0.05 on the cubic?)
